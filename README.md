## The UI

Early on in the project, I decided to make my sheets mimic the old-school _Final Fantasy_ menus. I personally like this style and I will not be changing it. Since somebody requested it early on in development, I did add some configuration options to change the color. It is not perfect and I will probably revisit that at a later date. Ultimately, I would like to make a few UI designs and just let you pick from those. It will take some time for me to add this and it isn't my top priority, so stay tuned.

## Status

This project is still in development and currently in a beta phase.

### Future Content

If/when new DLC or expansion modules are released for Fabula Ultima, I will probably get around to adding it in eventually. If a rule or new book features something that is optional, there is a chance I might not implement it.

## Installation

In order to install this system, you will need to download this repository as a zip file and extract it to your foundry/systems folder. Alternatively, you can use the url `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/razage/fabula-ultima-unofficial/master/system.json` in the "Manifest URL" field when you click "Install System"

### Recommended Modules

I've added a few modules that will make running this game _much_ easier. They are not required to operate, so I made them recommended. Here's my reasoning for each.

-   Challenge Tracker
    -   This game uses clocks. This is my preferred clock plugin. Use whatever one you prefer if you don't want to use this. My system does **not** implement clocks otherwise.
-   Lancer Initiative
    -   Fabula Ultima's initiative system is largely incompatible with Foundry. My implementation sucked, so I found this as a good alternative. With this, you just need to use the party sheet to make an initiative roll (DEX + INS) and compare it to the highest enemy initiative. It even lets you give bosses multiple turns.
